=============================
Setup a new project directory
=============================

The *pvWebMonitor* service is configured by files
configured by the user in a *project directory*.

To get default versions of the files, run this command::

   mkdir path/to/project/directory
   pvWebMonitor --setup path/to/project/directory
   cd path/to/project/directory

where *path/to/project/directory* is either a partial, relative,
or absolute path to an existing directory to be used.  Once this 
command has run, the files will be copied to the designated
directory.  If files with these names already exist, *pvWebMonitor*
will stop with an error report and not overwrite the existing files.
